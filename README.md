# Directions and Controls
Use the arrow keys to move left and right and SPACE to jump
Scoring goes up by 10 per every yin-yang orb you collect
extra features such as using the grid with the g button and a "sound effect" with z are there, the sound effect was supposed to be the laser but it could not get it to work, maybe in a future update It will be there so keep that in mind I guess

The goal of the game is to get to the end, and jump on the teleporter which is supposed to take you to the next level, since it is world 1 after you get through the onslaught of enemies and collect all the yin yang orbs the other half of the level will be some easy platforming.

# Known Glitches
Collision with enemies is very buggy, specially with the air type enemy
laser doesn't work but the sound does when you press the key
lose screen music only works if you press a key
for some reason the collision of the enemies going from left to right doesn't work (?) It used to work just fine and I'm not sure what caused it to stop functioning properly

# Backstory and behind the scenes
Aether the sequel is -obviously- the sequel to Aether Primordial the space shooter game, this time after defeating Emperor Sigma's ship you board into the metal empire to finish off Sigma's empire once and for all. 

As for why there are Yin Yang orbs...uh well its complicated but I originally intended the player design to be a sprite based off megaman, yes, but, it wasn't supposed to look exactly like him, more like a pose reference rather than a recolor (though I did draw the hero sprite out of memory of megaman's figure) I was thinking of a male and female character with different designs but as you can probably guess I ran into time constraints, art is hard to make and I think I made a good amount in a short time, the enemy designs aren't complete either, well except that cool masterchief look-alike but he's missing his arms. I think I can understand the pain of game developers a bit more now, it's not just coding lines, you have to spend so much time drawing and thinking of concepts too

The premise (in my head) was basically an eastern culture based rebellion vs a greek based empire, although I admitedly used the greek letters because they sound cool

As you can see I scrapped a lot of stuff in order to get a somewhat acceptable look for the game (you can even find unused images in the assets), its a high school project so it was bound to end up a little wonky, Hopefully in the future I will get some closure by learning more about code (and improving my art) so I can finish this.

I really hope you like how the art looks at least, and the music too, I hope you like the "metal_empire" song, truth is I have a bunch more songs that I never got to use, and I made that goal post theme as a remix of my unused boss theme, it's just a big "thank you"

Seriously, This class was awesome, I wish I got into it in an earlier year but it is what it is.
If I ever fully finish this game maybe I'll send it through email, I think my strong forts are art and surprisingly music but I'll try to learn a new coding language too.

Thanks for Everything
